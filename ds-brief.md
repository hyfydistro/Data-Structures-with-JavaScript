# Data Structures - Brief

Data structures, at a high level, are *techniques* for storing and organizing data that make it easier to modify, navigate, and access. Data structures determine how data is collected, the functions we can use to access it, and the relationships between data.

Data structures enable us to:

+ Manage and utilize large datasets
+ Search for particular data from a database
+ Design algorithms that are tailored towards particular programs
+ Handle multiple requests from users at once
+ Simplify and speed up data processing

Data structures are vital for efficient, real-world problem solving.

The way we organize data has a lot of impact on performance and useability.

# Data Structures in JavaScript

JavaScript has primitive and non-primitive data structures. **Primitive data structures** and data types are native to the programming language. These include boolean, null, number, string, etc. **Non-primitive data structures** are not defined by the programming language but rather by the programmer. These include linear data structures, static data structures, and dynamic data structures, like queue and linked lists.

## Array

An arrary stores data in memory for later use.
